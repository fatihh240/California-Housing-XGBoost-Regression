--- FINAL MODEL PERFORMANCE ---
Training Set (Train) -> R2: 0.9854 | RMSE: 13899.75
Test Set (Test)      -> R2: 0.8532 | RMSE: 44417.85
🏆 Final Decision: Model Selection (Summary)

🚀 After testing multiple models and optimization strategies, we deliberately selected a balanced XGBoost baseline model with 0.87 Train R² and 0.82 Test R².

⚠️ Although the optimized model reached an impressive ~0.98 Train R², its weaker test performance revealed overfitting. ⚖️ Our chosen model maintains a smaller gap between Train and Test scores, ensuring better generalization, higher stability, and more trustworthy predictions on unseen data.

✅ Key takeaway: 📉 Slightly lower training performance + 📈 strong test results = a smarter, real-world-ready model 💡
